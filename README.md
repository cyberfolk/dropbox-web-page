# Dropbox - Replica web-page

**Initial commit**: 13/02/23

**Tecnologie:** HTML, CSS e Flex.

**Info**: ðŸ“¥ðŸ“¦ Here is my Dropbox replica, again for Boolean!
The layout was created using Penpot and colored blocks, and then to arrange the elements the management of the grid and flex were fundamental. Done with pure HTML and CSS, grid and content management were key.
